# 🧠 Adaptive Auto Data Evaluation System (AADES)

**AADES** is a state-of-the-art, data-agnostic analytical platform that eliminates the need for manual data preprocessing and fixed parameters. It empowers researchers and analysts to transform raw datasets into actionable insights through an automated, intelligent evaluation pipeline.

---

## 🎯 The Core Problem
Most data analysis tools require specific input formats or hard-coded parameters. **AADES** solves this by dynamically adapting to any dataset (CSV, XLSX, JSON), automatically identifying schemas, and mapping the analysis engine to the user's strategic intent.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Data-Agnostic Engine**: Intelligent schema detection for heterogeneous datasets.
- **📊 Adaptive Visualizations**: Context-aware charts (Trend, Distribution, Correlation) that update in real-time.
- **💡 Automated Narratives**: Generates statistical insights and pattern discoveries using advanced analytical logic.
- **✨ Premium Experience**: Responsive dark-mode UI with glassmorphic aesthetics and smooth micro-interactions.
- **⚡ Zero-Config Processing**: In-memory data handling for high-speed, secure evaluation.

## ⚙️ Architecture & Logic

1.  **Ingestion**: Files (CSV, XLSX, JSON) are validated and converted into optimized DataFrames.
2.  **Schema Inference**: Automated detection of numerical, categorical, and temporal data points.
3.  **Intent Mapping**: User selects analysis goals (e.g., "Trend Analysis"), and the system selects the best statistical models.
4.  **Diagnostic Visualization**: Real-time rendering of complex relationships and distributions.
5.  **Insight Generation**: Automated narrative reports highlight correlations, anomalies, and trends.
